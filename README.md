# Meta Wallet
An Electron.js desktop wallet for EVM compatible networks like Ethereum, Fantom, Matic and etc. 
### This software is still under development, do not use it as a real wallet, because it's not stable yet and it may cause some security flaws !!!!

# Motivation

I started this project to provide a unified wallet for desktop platforms, to be able to use some functionalities of MetaMask wallet, and in extra to provide an IPC api for desktop games which have been built with game engines like Unity and Unreal to ease the use of the Web3, NFT, and smart contracts in meta-verse games.

# Contribution

I welcome Electron.js developers to join this open-source software for contributing.
Please send me a dm on Telegram for details: @alireza_cbot
